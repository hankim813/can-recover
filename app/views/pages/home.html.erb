			<h1>CAN Recover Foundation</h1><br><br>
			<p>CAN Recover Foundation’s mission is to provide support for student-athlete’s suffering post-concussion syndrome and educate those in the community surrounding them. Studies have shown that a student-athlete undergoing a prolonged concussions recovery would find another student-athlete who has experienced it first hand to be most trustworthy, effective, and empathetic. CAN Recover is the only organization to provide this support.</p>
